                        <p>
                            In the next section we will describe an overview of the application, highlighting the
                            architecture of the WADO App, detailing its key components and their interactions.
                            The application follows a client-server model, where the frontend communicates with the
                            backend via a REST API. This architectural design ensures <strong>scalability</strong>, as
                            the server can be asynchronously deployed on multiple instances to handle more requests,
                            <strong>maintainability</strong>, as the separation of concerns allows for easier updates
                            and debugging, and <strong>flexibility</strong>, allowing seamless integration with cloud
                            deployment and further enhancements. Additionally, it ensures <strong>performance</strong>,
                            as the load can be balanced across multiple servers, and <strong>security</strong>, as
                            the backend can be protected behind firewalls and other security measures.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The architecture consists of three main components:
                        <ul class="content is-list">
                            <li>

                                <span>
                                    - A modular, component-based structure, developed using Angular Framework, that
                                    handles user interactions and displays data fetched from the backend. It includes
                                    multiple pages such as authentication, data visualization, and SPARQL query
                                    execution.
                                </span>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="has-text-primary">Backend Component</span>
                                <span>
                                    - A RESTful API that is responsible for processing user requests, querying the
                                    RDF dataset, and returning structured responses in JSON format. Authentication
                                    and access control mechanisms ensure secure data handling while the API is
                                    developed using Flask Framework. The backend is responsible for processing user
                                    requests, querying the RDF dataset, and returning structured responses in JSON
                                    format.
                                </span>

                                <span>
                                    - A RDF dataset that allows efficient querying and retrieval of data. The dataset
                                    is queried using SPARQL, a query language for RDF datasets. The ontology is
                                    in OWL format and provides a rich and structured representation of the data models
                                    to provide comprehensive information for web development, including
                                    programming languages, frameworks, licenses, and other related topics. To populate
                                    the ontology we retrived data from the GitHub GraphQL API and the DBpedia SPARQL API
                                    to ensure a rich and diverse dataset.
                                </span>

                                    - A PostgreSQL database is used to store user data securely. It is deployed on a
                                    separate server to ensure data integrity, security, and performance. The database
                                    handles user authentication, authorization, and stores user-related information
                                    like email and password. The database is accessed by the backend to store and
                                    retrieve user data.
                                </span>

                                This diagram illustrates the overall architecture of the application, showing the
                                interaction between the frontend, backend, the database and the ontology, and how
                                user requests are processed, and how data flows through the system. It
                                highlights how the user interacts with our responsive UI which ensures a seamless
                                user experience. User requests are sent to the backend to be processed via our
                                two APIs: the Auth API and the Ontology API. The Auth API handles user authentication
                                and authorization, ensuring secure access to the application while interacting with the
                                database. The Ontology API queries the RDF dataset to retrieve relevant information
                                based on user requests.

                                The frontend is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to
                                navigate through the application and access the features they need. The frontend
                                communicates with the backend via two RESTful APIs to fetch data and update the UI
                                dynamically.

                                Regarding the data flow, the frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes the
                                data and responds with relevant information. The frontend then dynamically updates the
                                UI based on the received data. This ensures that the user interface is always up-to-date
                                and responsive to user interactions.
                            </p>

                            <div class="box mt-3">

                                    The frontend is developed using <strong>Angular Framework</strong>, a popular
                                    frontend framework that provides a
                                    modular and component-based structure for building scalable web applications. The UI
                                    components are modular and reusable, allowing
                                    for easy customization and maintenance. The UI includes components for user
                                    authentication, data visualization and querying. The frontend communicates with the
                                    backend via two RESTful APIs to fetch data and update the UI dynamically, all of
                                    this being made by using the Angular HTTPClient module to send requests to the
                                    backend and receive responses. For development we used version 19.1.4 of Angular.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For styling the UI components we used <strong> Bulma CSS framework</strong>, which
                                    provides a clean
                                    and modern look to the application. The UI components are designed to be responsive
                                    and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and
                                    screen sizes. To have the lastest features available in Bulma Framework we used the
                                    version 1.0.3.

                                    The UI includes components for exposing the functionalities of both APIs provided by
                                    the backend: the Auth API and the Ontology API. The Auth API components include
                                    user authentication page and user registration page, while the Ontology API
                                    components include SPARQL query execution page, framework data visualization page,
                                    a page for visualizing instances for each class available in the ontology, and a
                                    page for visualizing the properties of an instance available in the ontology.
                                    Besides these pages, the UI also includes a home page and a navigation bar for
                                    easy access to the different sections of the application.

                                        The navigation bar is a component that is present on all pages of the
                                        application. It provides users with easy access to the different sections of the
                                        application, including the home page, authentication pages, and ontology pages.
                                        The navigation bar is responsive
                                        and adapts to different screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.
                                        When
                                        the screen size is reduced, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu.
