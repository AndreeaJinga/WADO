                        <p>
                            In the next section we will describe an overview of the application, highlighting the
                            architecture of the WADO App, detailing its key components and their interactions.
                            The application follows a client-server model, where the frontend communicates with the
                            backend via a REST API. This architectural design ensures <strong>scalability</strong>, as
                            the server can be asynchronously deployed on multiple instances to handle more requests,
                            <strong>maintainability</strong>, as the separation of concerns allows for easier updates
                            and debugging, and <strong>flexibility</strong>, allowing seamless integration with cloud
                            deployment and further enhancements. Additionally, it ensures <strong>performance</strong>,
                            as the load can be balanced across multiple servers, and <strong>security</strong>, as
                            the backend can be protected behind firewalls and other security measures.
                        </p>

                                    - A modular, component-based structure, developed using Angular Framework, that
                                    handles user interactions and displays data fetched from the backend. It includes
                                    multiple pages such as authentication, data visualization, and SPARQL query
                                    execution.

                                    - A RESTful API that is responsible for processing user requests, querying the
                                    RDF dataset, and returning structured responses in JSON format. Authentication
                                    and access control mechanisms ensure secure data handling while the API is
                                    developed using Flask Framework. The backend is responsible for processing user
                                    requests, querying the RDF dataset, and returning structured responses in JSON

                                    - A RDF dataset that allows efficient querying and retrieval of data. The dataset
                                    is queried using SPARQL, a query language for RDF datasets. The ontology is
                                    in OWL format and provides a rich and structured representation of the data models
                                    to provide comprehensive information for web development, including
                                    programming languages, frameworks, licenses, and other related topics. To populate
                                    the ontology we retrived data from the GitHub GraphQL API and the DBpedia SPARQL API
                                    to ensure a rich and diverse dataset.

                                This diagram illustrates the overall architecture of the application, showing the
                                interaction between the frontend, backend, the database and the ontology, and how
                                user requests are processed, and how data flows through the system. It
                                highlights how the user interacts with our responsive UI which ensures a seamless
                                user experience. User requests are sent to the backend to be processed via our
                                two APIs: the Auth API and the Ontology API. The Auth API handles user authentication
                                and authorization, ensuring secure access to the application while interacting with the
                                database. The Ontology API queries the RDF dataset to retrieve relevant information
                                based on user requests.

                                The frontend is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users to
                                navigate through the application and access the features they need. The frontend
                                communicates with the backend via two RESTful APIs to fetch data and update the UI
                                dynamically.

                                Regarding the data flow, the frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes the
                                data and responds with relevant information. The frontend then dynamically updates the
                                UI based on the received data. This ensures that the user interface is always up-to-date
                                and responsive to user interactions.
                            </p>

                                    The frontend is developed using <strong>Angular Framework</strong>, a popular
                                    frontend framework that provides a
                                    modular and component-based structure for building scalable web applications. The UI
                                    components are modular and reusable, allowing
                                    for easy customization and maintenance. The UI includes components for user
                                    authentication, data visualization and querying. The frontend communicates with the
                                    backend via two RESTful APIs to fetch data and update the UI dynamically, all of
                                    this being made by using the Angular HTTPClient module to send requests to the
                                    backend and receive responses. For development we used version 19.1.4 of Angular.

                                <p>
                                    For styling the UI components we used <strong> Bulma CSS framework</strong>, which
                                    provides a clean
                                    and modern look to the application. The UI components are designed to be responsive
                                    and accessible, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and
                                    screen sizes. To have the lastest features available in Bulma Framework we used the
                                    version 1.0.3.

                                    The UI includes components for exposing the functionalities of both APIs provided by
                                    the backend: the Auth API and the Ontology API. The Auth API components include
                                    user authentication page and user registration page, while the Ontology API
                                    components include SPARQL query execution page, framework data visualization page,
                                    a page for visualizing instances for each class available in the ontology, and a
                                    page for visualizing the properties of an instance available in the ontology.
                                    Besides these pages, the UI also includes a home page and a navigation bar for
                                    easy access to the different sections of the application.

                                        The navigation bar is a component that is present on all pages of the
                                        application. It provides users with easy access to the different sections of the
                                        application, including the home page, authentication pages, and ontology pages.
                                        The navigation bar is responsive
                                        and adapts to different screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience.
                                        When
                                        the screen size is reduced, the navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu.

                                    The backend is developed using <strong>Flask Framework</strong>, a lightweight and
                                    flexible framework for building web applications. Flask provides a simple and
                                    extensible structure for developing RESTful APIs, making it ideal for building
                                    scalable and maintainable web applications. The backend is responsible for
                                    processing
                                    user requests, querying the RDF dataset, and returning structured responses in JSON
                                    format. The backend is developed using Flask Framework, version 3.1.0.

                                    The backend uses Flask-Cors to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
                                    (CORS) requests, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend securely.
                                    The backend uses Flask-JWT-Extended for user authentication and
                                    authorization, ensuring secure access to the application. The backend uses
                                    Flask-RESTful
                                    to create RESTful APIs, making it easy to define routes and handle user requests.
                                    The backend uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the PostgreSQL
                                    database, ensuring secure data handling and efficient data retrieval. The backend
                                    uses PyJWT for
                                    JSON Web Token (JWT) handling, ensuring secure user authentication and
                                    authorization.
                                    The backend uses rdflib to interact with the RDF dataset, ensuring
                                    efficient querying and retrieval of data.
                                </p>

                                    The backend provides two RESTful APIs: the Auth API and the Ontology API. The Auth
                                    API is responsible for user authentication and authorization, while the Ontology API
                                    is responsible for querying the RDF dataset and
                                    returning structured responses in JSON format. The APIs are designed to be
                                    extensible, allowing for easy addition of new routes and functionalities as needed.
                                </p>

                                        The Auth API provides endpoints for user authentication and authorization. The
                                        API includes routes for user registration, user login, and user logout. The API
                                        uses JWT tokens for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that
                                        only authenticated users can access the application. The API is designed to be
                                        secure and efficient, ensuring that user data is handled safely and securely.

                                        The Auth API includes the following routes:
                                    <ul class="content is-list">
                                        <li>

                                            <span>
                                                : A POST route for user registration, allowing users to create a new
                                                account by providing their email and password. The route returns a
                                                success message if the user is registered successfully, or an error
                                                message if the user already exists or the input is invalid.

                                between the team members.
                                The source code of the application can be found on

                                repository, so anyone can access it and see the code.
                                The code is divided into multiple folders, each folder containing a specific part of the
                                application.
                                The main folders are:

                            The ontology of the application is a RDF dataset that allows efficient querying and
                            retrieval of data. The dataset is queried using SPARQL, a query language for RDF datasets.
                            The ontology is in OWL format and provides a rich and structured representation of the data
                            models to provide comprehensive information for web development, including programming
                            languages, frameworks, licenses, and other related topics. To populate the ontology we
                            retrived data from the GitHub GraphQL API and the DBpedia SPARQL API to ensure a rich and
                            diverse dataset.

                                organized based on their relationships and properties, allowing for efficient querying
                                and retrieval of data. The ontology is designed to be extensible, allowing for
                                easy addition of new classes and instances as needed. The ontology includes classes for:

                            For a better understanding of the ontology, we provide a graph that illustrates the classes
                            and the relations between them. The first graph was generated using the <strong>Protege
                                Application</strong>.

                                To populate the ontology, we retrieved data from the GitHub GraphQL API and the DBpedia
                                SPARQL API. The GitHub GraphQL API provides information about programming languages and
                                useful metadata such as description, url, creation year, and license. The DBpedia SPARQL
                                API provides information about software frameworks, including their authors, release
                                date and license. The data was transformed into RDF/XML format. To obtain a rich and
                                diverse dataset, we retrieved data from multiple sources and combined it into a single
                                ontology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To obtain a consistent and full ontology, we mapped existent data from both APIs to our
                                classes and properties, by searching for classes names as tags in the GitHub API. At the
                                end, we mapped the tag, which was our class, with the found object from the API via an
                                existing property. The same process was done for the DBpedia API, but in this case, we
                                searched for the framework name in the API and mapped it to our class.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ontology was then imported into the RDF database and queried using SPARQL to
                                retrieve relevant information based on user requests.
                                As a 'in progress' state, the output from running the GraphQL GitHub API is present in

                                The final ontology was created by combining the data from both APIs and ensuring that
                                the classes and properties are consistent and well-defined. The ontology provides a rich
                                and structured representation of the data models, allowing for efficient querying and
                                retrieval of data.

                                The final ontology is available in the following file: <a

                                And for exemplification purposes, we provide a sample of the ontology below using the

                                To demonstrate the capabilities of the ontology, we provide some interesting queries
                                that can be executed using SPARQL. These queries allow users to retrieve specific
                                information from the ontology based on their requirements. The queries are designed to
                                showcase the flexibility and power of the ontology in querying and retrieving data.
